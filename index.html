            <h3>Meet Howard! The celery nutrtion and recipe expert!</h3>
            <p>Yup that’s me, I was born and raised in Banff, AB, Canada. I love all things mountains, nature and healthy living. I enjoy cooking with whole foods and firing up my juicer too!</p>
            <p>I like to keep things simple, grow plants and herbs in the summer then preserve what I can in the fall. A few years back I was having some health issues and found out about the potential benefits of Celery Juice. I felt like I had tried everything, so I thought why not try it! I've used celery to optimize my health, control my weight and keep me energized.</p>

A glass of celery juice in the morning can improve digestion, balance pH levels and give you a boost of energy. If you’re not sold on the taste by itself pair it with an apple, some lemon and cucumber for a taste boost. Not to mention the additional health benefits that those provide too!</p>
